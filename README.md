juandirection
=============

JuanDirection is a website that allows the commuter to input a source and a destination, and would generate possible routes on how to get there. This is kind of like sakay.ph, but there will be additional features like showing the traffic (this might be bound by the data available in MMDA's site), and allowing the user to specify how the routes will be sorted (cheapest price first, shortest time first, etc). The goal of the site is to give commuters a way to choose the 'best' route for them.
