# Sakay.ph

Sakay.ph is a webapp that aims to help people use jeepneys, buses, and trains in Metro Manila. It's like Google Maps, but for commuting!

Originally built for the [Philippine Transit App Challenge](http://philippine-transit.hackathome.com).

This is the webapp side that displays a map and allows you to route using it. The SMS gateway is found at https://github.com/sakay/sakay-gateway

Our back-end can be found at http://planner.sakay.ph/ — please let us know if you’re using it!
